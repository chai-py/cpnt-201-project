   As part of a web design project at SAIT, I created a mood board for a yoga studio, focusing on capturing the brand’s essence and aesthetic through visual elements. Using Figma, I curated a cohesive color palette, typography, and imagery that reflected the studio's calm, inviting, and wellness-focused atmosphere. The mood board was designed to serve as a foundation for future website design, ensuring that all elements—such as user interface components and imagery—aligned with the studio’s brand identity. The project emphasized creating a peaceful and harmonious visual experience to enhance user engagement and brand recognition.
